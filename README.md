# 2024-DTSpoor-Pointcloud-client

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the rendering of large point cloud datasets in a virtual reality (VR) environment using Unity and a Meta Quest Pro HMD. The goal is to visualize point clouds in real-time while maintaining high performance, allowing users to explore large datasets in an immersive VR environment.

The project uses an octree-based approach for efficient point cloud management, including optimizations such as frustum culling, occlusion culling, and dynamic foveated rendering to ensure smooth frame rates and a high level of detail.

## Features
- **Point Cloud Rendering in VR**: Visualize large point cloud datasets in a fully immersive VR environment.
- **Optimized
